# Roomer v1 🏨

Welcome to Roomer v1, an innovative web app designed to revolutionize communication between the front desk and housekeeping department in hotels. Say goodbye to paper sheets and hello to real-time room updates!

## 📢 Introduction

Roomer v1 helps streamline communication with the housekeeping department. Front desk staff can enter information about rooms due for check-out, and this information is instantly displayed to housekeeping members on their phones or office computers.

## 💡 Why I Made It

Working at a hotel, I noticed that during check-out time, we rely on paper sheets to track live information of the rooms that check out. A housekeeping supervisor then has to physically come to the desk to take a snapshot of the sheet. This system is inefficient and prone to errors. Roomer v1 was created to address these issues.

## 🚀 What It Does

With Roomer v1, the front desk can relay live information about rooms during check-out time, eliminating the need for a paper-based system. Key features include:
- Tracking rooms that are checking out and getting vacated.
- Managing late check-outs.
- Identifying rooms that plan to stay over again.
- Flagging rooms that were no-shows.
- Reporting rooms that require housekeeping assistance.

This app enhances efficiency and productivity while reducing miscommunication errors.

## 🔧 How the App Works

Roomer v1 uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on data. Here’s how it works:
1. **Add Room**: Users can add room information through the "Add room" box or the "Notes" section.
2. **Data Storage**: Information is stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring it persists even after a page refresh.
3. **Real-Time Updates**: The app dynamically updates the displayed information, making it instantly available to housekeeping staff.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Divs, unordered lists, ordered lists, href tags, image tags, nav tag, containers, input, onclick, onkeyup, class, id, buttons.
- **CSS**: Margins, padding, flexbox, grid layouts, centering divs, hover effects, background settings, fonts, borders, scrollbars.
- **JavaScript**: Variables (const, let), functions, local storage, loops, conditional statements, DOM manipulation, creating/updating/removing HTML elements, live time/date display, data searching.
- **Git**: Version control with commands like `git pull`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git branches`, `git force`, `git merge`, `pull requests`, and `git reset`.
- **Bootstrap**: Work in progress ⏳

## 📚 What I Learned

Developing Roomer v1 taught me a lot about web development:
- **HTML**: Structuring web pages with various tags and attributes.
- **CSS**: Styling web pages using modern layout techniques like flexbox and grid.
- **JavaScript**: Writing efficient and dynamic scripts to manipulate the DOM and handle data.
- **Git**: Effective version control and collaboration using commands such as `git pull`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git branches`, `git force`, `git fetch`, `git merge`, `pull requests`, and `git reset`.
- **Bootstrap**: Loading ⏳

## 🔮 Future Versions

Exciting features planned for future versions of Roomer include:
- Full integration with **Bootstrap** for mobile usability.
- **Multiple user support** with different access permissions.
- Transitioning to a **database** for more robust data storage.
- Additional features for housekeepers, room checkers, and supervisors to further smooth operations.
