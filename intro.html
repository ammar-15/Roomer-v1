                <p>Welcome to Roomer! Roomer is a web application designed to streamline communication between the front desk and the housekeeping department in a hotel. Here’s a detailed walkthrough of the app's features and how to use them:</p>
                
                <h3>Home Page</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Date and Time</strong>: The top section displays the current date and time, along with daily information including guests staying in-house, those continuing their stay, and the total number of checkouts for the day.<br>
                    <strong>Print Option</strong>: At the end of the day, you can print all the data from all pages. This hard copy helps locate any errors or room-specific information in the future and can be filed away with the daily paperwork.<br>
                    <strong>Reset All Button</strong>: This button clears all local storage to prepare for the next day.<br>
                    <strong>Checkouts Screen</strong>: <br>
                    - <em>Room Input</em>: Add a room that has checked out, and it will automatically be assigned to its respective floor (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th).<br>
                    - <em>Search Room</em>: Search for any room using the input box.<br>
                    - <em>Remove Room</em>: If you accidentally added a wrong room or if a room decides to stay another night after checking out, you can remove it using this feature.
                </p>
        
                <h3>Late Checkouts Page</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Late Checkouts Information</strong>: Displays information about rooms checking out after the standard checkout time (12 PM, 1 PM, or 2 PM).<br>
                    <strong>Checkbox</strong>: Mark a room as left using the checkbox.<br>
                    <strong>Remove Feature</strong>: Remove a room if you accidentally added the wrong room.
                </p>
        
                <h3>New Stayovers Page</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>New Stayovers Information</strong>: Add rooms that were originally due to check out but have decided to stay another night. This helps housekeeping receive real-time updates.<br>
                    <strong>Checkbox</strong>: Mark necessary procedures as completed for the stayover room.
                </p>
        
                <h3>No Shows Page</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>No Shows Information</strong>: Lists rooms that didn’t check in last night.<br>
                    <strong>Checkbox</strong>: Mark them as completed for payment and out of the system.
                </p>
        
                <h3>Notes Page</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Notes</strong>: Pass information to the housekeeping department about rooms needing extra cleaning, towels, sheets, coffee cups, maintenance, etc.<br>
                    <strong>Search Box</strong>: Search for specific notes.<br>
                    <strong>Remove Note</strong>: Double-click on a note to remove it. An alert will pop up to confirm the deletion, preventing accidental clicks.
